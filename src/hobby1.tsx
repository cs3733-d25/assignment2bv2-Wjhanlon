            <h2>Patrick's Hobby: Music</h2>
            <p id="hobby">
                I have been playing and listening to music since a very young age.
                I technically started playing trumpet in 3rd grade as Winthrop in my high school's performance of The Music Man.
                I have been in many different ensembles since and have played various styles of music from classical to jazz to orchestral.
                I also listen to many different genres of music in my free time.
